# 1-Month Advanced Python Learning Plan

## Week 1: Intermediate Python Concepts
- List, set, and dictionary comprehensions
- Advanced string manipulation and formatting
- Working with iterators and generators
- Lambda, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
- Introduction to decorators and context managers
- Practice: Write custom generator and decorator

## Week 2: Robustness & OOP
- Exception hierarchy, custom exceptions
- Advanced file handling (CSV, JSON, context managers)
- Object-oriented programming: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- Special methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, etc.)
- Property decorators (`@property`)
- Practice: Build a class hierarchy with custom methods

## Week 3: Modules, Packages & Testing
- Organizing code: modules, packages, `__init__.py`
- Virtual environments and dependency management (`venv`, `pip`)
- Unit testing with `unittest` and `pytest`
- Logging and debugging techniques
- Practice: Write and test a small package

## Week 4: Applied Python (Web, Data, Automation)
- Introduction to web development with Flask or FastAPI
- Consuming APIs with `requests`
- Basic data analysis with `pandas` and `matplotlib`
- Automating tasks (file operations, web scraping with `BeautifulSoup`)
- Final project: Choose one (web app, data analysis, automation script)
- Next steps: Explore concurrency (`asyncio`, threading), type hints, further resources
